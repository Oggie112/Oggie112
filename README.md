## Hi there 👋


Software developer passionate about full-stack development, currently deepening my expertise in Express and Node.js. 

I have previously worked in the legal sector after studying History and Law at university, where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills. My shift into tech stems from a love of building, fixing, and creating — whether on a computer or in real life. 

Currently training with Founders & Coders, I’m looking forward to contributing to interesting projects and collaborating with other developers.
