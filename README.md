# Hi there, I'm David ðŸ‘‹

Passionate fullstack software developer with a background in the legal sector as an Ombudsman. I developed strong analytical skills and inter-personal skills while working in a high pressure workplace with challenging client dynamics. My shift into tech stemmed from a love of building and creating things around the house. The problem-solving process I enjoy in DIY projects translates directly into coding, where I find the same satisfaction in bringing ideas to life.
