# Hi there, I'm David ðŸ‘‹

Full-stack software developer with a unique background as an Ombudsman. My transition into tech was sparked by a passion for building â€” from hands-on DIY projects to interactive software applications. Strong analytical and interpersonal skills from working in high-pressure, client-facing environments. Driven by solving problems, listening to users, and turning ideas into real-life products.

| **Wordle** - A recreation of Wordle using Typecript, Tailwind & Html.  | **Tarotation App** - A fun media recommendation app using OpenAi, Node.Js, Express, Javascript & Tailwind created as part of a team. Deliberately built with restrictions such as no frontend frameworks or database. |

## I'm currently researching

- TailwindCss in order to write cleaner, quicker and more concise code
- MongoDB and how it relates to SQL and PostgreSQL and why one might be preferred over another
- Pyhton simply becasuse I enjoy it
